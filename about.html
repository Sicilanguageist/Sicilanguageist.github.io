    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I have been interested in languages and linguistics since I was a little child. Over the years, I started developing a passion for the topic of orthography; I would often try and reform spelling systems and romanisations from all over the world. I then went to university to study English and Finnish, and that’s when the first buds of ROR sprouted.</p>
    <p>I started working on Romance Orthographic Reintegrationism while I was studying in Bologna in April 2023. The idea came to me because the language of Bologna, Emilian, uses a complicated, diacritic-heavy, and—might I say—questionable orthography. So I started thinking about what could improve this spelling system, and I noticed that a more etymological approach would “clear” the language of many diacritics and remove some of the more confusing and off-putting features of the orthography. Soon enough, I started doing this for other Romance languages of Italy, and that’s how the bulk of the system was created.</p>
    <p>I have mostly worked on ROR by myself, but I’ve received valuable input from the people around me, especially my brother, who (paradoxically) knows more about Romance linguistics than I do.</p>
    <p>I am not sure where this project will lead me but it has already gifted me of delightful conversations about orthography, language and identity. I hope you will find it useful in some way.</p>
