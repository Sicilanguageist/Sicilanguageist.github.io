    <h2 id="generalprinciples">General principles</h2>

    <p>In this section, I will explain the overarching principles behind ROR guidelines.</p>

    <h3 id="attested">Attested Romance orthographic practices</h3>

    <p>The central idea behind ROR is to reintegrate the orthography of Romance minority languages through the implementation of orthographic conventions used in Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, Occitan, French, Italian and, to a lesser extent, Romanian.</p>

    <p>This is achieved by acknowledging what these orthographic conventions are and by understanding what their <i>etymological</i> role is within the system they are borrowed from. A further recommendation is to avoid letters and multigraphs (di-, tri- and quadrigraphs) that are not used in the languages of reference. The use of ⟨w⟩ and ⟨k⟩ is especially discouraged, unless finding another solution proves unworkable.</p>

    <p>This idea is also valid for diacritics. For example, the use of double dots above a character as a diacritic (⟨ä, ë, ï, ö, ü⟩) should be reserved for use as a diaeresis rather than an umlaut, i.e. it should not indicate a change in vowel quality, unless finding another option is difficult.</p>

    <h3 id="etymologicalcriterion">Etymological criterion</h3>

    <p>The details of the so-called <i>etymological criterion</i> are better explained in §ROR prescriptions. The main idea is that the reflexes and evolution of certain Latin consonants and consonant clusters determine how certain sounds are represented. These newly established spelling conventions can then be extended to non-etymological contexts. Therefore, a ROR orthography ought not to be exclusively historical: etymology is just the method used to <i>justify</i> spelling choices in certain contexts so that they can be used non-etymologically—according to the restrictions that will be explained below.</p>

    <p>I will give an example. Old Spanish spelt [ʃ] as ⟨x⟩ and [ʒ] as ⟨j⟩ or ⟨g⟩. Over the centuries, these sounds merged into the sound [x], and the distinction between them was lost. To reflect this merger, it was decided that ⟨j⟩ should be used for the sound [x] where ⟨x⟩ was used in the past (in contrast, the use of ⟨g⟩ remained the same, but that falls outside the scope of this example). In this case, the use of ⟨j⟩ was extended to non-etymological contexts—an example of how a historically motivated choice can develop into a general spelling rule, within the limits of ROR.</p>

    <h3 id="readeroriented">Reader-oriented approach and orthographic depth</h3>

    <p>Depending on the language’s phonological history, a reintegrationist orthography may turn out to be historical to various degrees, and therefore more or less difficult to write in. For example, compare the Catalan words <i lang="ca">cena</i> “dinner” (an archaic term) and <i lang="ca">sena</i> “number six in a game of dice, sice”. Both words are pronounced the same, but their initial consonant is spelt differently according to etymology. This makes it more difficult for the writer to predict or recall the exact spelling of a word.</p>

    <p>Romance reintegrationism promotes facilitating the reader rather than the writer. That is, while a single phoneme may be represented by multiple graphemes, each grapheme should ideally correspond to only one phoneme. It is possible that this principle cannot be implemented fully, and that mostly depends on how complex the phonemic inventory of the language is. Sacrificing this principle might be needed to make the orthography less crowded with diacritics (see §<a href="#economy">Economy</a>) and less cumbersome for both the reader and the writer.</p>
