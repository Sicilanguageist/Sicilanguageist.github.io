    <--! <h1>Guidelines and Rules</h1>

    <h2>General Principles</h2>
    <p>In this section, I will explain the overarching principles behind ROR guidelines.</p>

    <h3>Attested Romance orthographic practices</h3>
    <p>The central idea behind ROR is to reintegrate the orthography of Romance minority languages through the implementation of orthographic conventions used in Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, Occitan, French, Italian and, to a lesser extent, Romanian.</p>
    <p>This is achieved by acknowledging what these orthographic conventions are and by understanding what their etymological role is within the system they are borrowed from. A further recommendation is to avoid letters and multigraphs (di-, tri- and quadrigraphs) that are not used in the languages of reference. The use of ⟨w⟩ and ⟨k⟩ is especially discouraged, unless finding another solution proves unworkable.</p>
    <p>This idea is also valid for diacritics. For example, the use of double dots above a character as a diacritic (⟨ä, ë, ï, ö, ü⟩) should be reserved for use as a diaeresis rather than an umlaut, i.e. it should not indicate a change in vowel quality, unless finding another option is difficult.</p>

    <h3>Etymological criterion</h3>
    <p>The details of the so-called etymological criterion are better explained in §ROR prescriptions. The main idea is that the reflexes and evolution of certain Latin consonants and consonant clusters determine how certain sounds are represented. These newly established spelling conventions can then be extended to non-etymological contexts. Therefore, a ROR orthography ought not to be exclusively historical: etymology is just the method used to justify spelling choices in certain contexts so that they can be used non-etymologically—according to the restrictions that will be explained below.</p>
    <p>I will give an example. Old Spanish spelt [ʃ] as ⟨x⟩ and [ʒ] as ⟨j⟩ or ⟨g⟩. Over the centuries, these sounds merged into the sound [x], and the distinction between them was lost. To reflect this merger, it was decided that ⟨j⟩ should be used for the sound [x] where ⟨x⟩ was used in the past (in contrast, the use of ⟨g⟩ remained the same, but that falls outside the scope of this example). In this case, the use of ⟨j⟩ was extended to non-etymological contexts—an example of how a historically motivated choice can develop into a general spelling rule, within the limits of ROR.</p>

    <h3>Reader-oriented approach and orthographic depth</h3>
    <p>Depending on the language’s phonological history, a reintegrationist orthography may turn out to be historical to various degrees, and therefore more or less difficult to write in. For example, compare the Catalan words <em>cena</em> “dinner” (an archaic term) and <em>sena</em> “number six in a game of dice, sice”. Both words are pronounced the same, but their initial consonant is spelt differently according to etymology. This makes it more difficult for the writer to predict or recall the exact spelling of a word.</p>
    <p>Romance reintegrationism promotes facilitating the reader rather than the writer. That is, while a single phoneme may be represented by multiple graphemes, each grapheme should ideally correspond to only one phoneme. It is possible that this principle cannot be implemented fully, and that mostly depends on how complex the phonemic inventory of the language is. Sacrificing this principle might be needed to make the orthography less crowded with diacritics (see §Economy) and less cumbersome for both the reader and the writer.</p>

    <h3>Economy</h3>
    <p>An important rule of ROR is the avoidance of double marking: a particular element or feature cannot be indicated more than once. As an example, Bolognese Emilian [mʌnd] “world” is written <em>månnd</em>. The double ⟨n⟩ marks the preceding vowel as short, but [ʌ] ⟨å⟩ is always short, so there is no need for a double ⟨n⟩.</p>
    <p>ROR also discourages the extensive use of diacritics, unless they are well established in the reference languages mentioned above. This ties nicely with the principle of avoidance of double marking: stress is sometimes overmarked in writing by RMLs. One way of preventing this is to establish rules for a default interpretation of stress placement in an accent-less word; those words which defy the established rules will be marked by an accent (acute or grave).</p>

    <h2>ROR prescriptions</h2>
    <p>Here, the word “prescription” is used to define guidelines that are not considered general principles behind ROR, and which are more practical and specific in nature. These prescriptions are rooted in Latin etymology, but—as already stated—etymology should not be overly dominant in a Romance reintegrationist orthography. Remember that these prescriptions are suggestive in nature and allow for flexibility. <b>I will use the symbol ‘$’ to indicate proposed spellings. These are merely examples used to illustrate ROR prescriptions and should not be interpreted as formal orthographic proposals.</b></p>
    <p>Some of these ideas can contradict each other, so choosing one option over another is definitely acceptable. If a prescription is essential for creating a ROR orthography, it will be stated.</p>
    <h3>Palatal and palatalised sounds</h3>
    <h4 id="latyod">Latin yod</h4>
    <p>“Yod” here refers to the phone [j].</p>
    <p>The modern reflex of word-initial Latin yod at the beginning of a stressed syllable will determine the use of ⟨j⟩. For example, since Latin *<smallcaps>iocat</smallcaps> (“he/she plays”) evolved into Venetian [ˈzoga], that initial Venetian [z] can be written ⟨j⟩ (for example $<i>joga</i>).</p>
    <p><strong>The Italian route.</strong> The evolution of yod in this context usually coincides with the evolution of the prevocalic Latin sequences -<smallcaps>di</smallcaps>- and -<smallcaps>gi</smallcaps>-. Therefore, the resulting sound from this merger can be spelt the same as these sequences even in contexts where it comes from yod. This is the convention adopted in Italian.</p>
      <example>
        <smallcaps>ho<impt>di</impt>ē</smallcaps> “today” → It. <i>o<impt>ggi</impt></i>
      </example>
      <example>
        <smallcaps><impt>i</impt>ūnium</smallcaps> “June” → It. <i><impt>gi</impt>ugno</i>
      </example>
      <example>
        <smallcaps>me<impt>di</impt>um</smallcaps> “middle” → Ven. $<i>me<impt>gi</impt>o</i>, <i>me<impt>j</impt>o</i>, <i>me<impt>x</impt>o</i>, etc.
      </example>
      <example>
        *<smallcaps>iocat</smallcaps> → Ven. [ˈzoga] $<i><impt>gi</impt>oga</i>, <i><impt>j</impt>oga</i>, <i><impt>x</impt>oga</i>, etc.
      </example>
      <p>
       <strong>The Catalan route.</strong> The general rule for this in Catalan is different. I will explain it to the best of my abilities, but note that the following is an oversimplification. Catalan treats the [(d)ʒ] sound that came from Latin yod the same as Latin <smallcaps>g</smallcaps> before <smallcaps>e</smallcaps> and <smallcaps>i</smallcaps>. For most cases, [(d)ʒ] is written ⟨g⟩ before ⟨e, i⟩ and ⟨j⟩ before ⟨a, o, u⟩. This means that, if Latin yod has the same reflex as <smallcaps>g</smallcaps> before <smallcaps>e</smallcaps> and <smallcaps>i</smallcaps>, then they can be treated the same as Catalan: said reflex—which is [(d)ʒ]—is written ⟨g⟩ before ⟨e, i⟩ and another choice has to be made before other vowel letters.
      </p>
      <example>
        <smallcaps><impt>g</impt>entem</smallcaps> “people” → Cat. [ˈ(d)ʒen(t)] <i><impt>g</impt>ent</i>
      </example>
      <example>
        <smallcaps><impt>i</impt>ūnium</smallcaps> “June” → Cat. [ˈ(d)ʒuɲ] <i><impt>j</impt>uny</i>
      </example>
      <example>
        <smallcaps>me<impt>di</impt>um</smallcaps> “middle” → Ven. $<i>me<impt>gi</impt>o</i>, <i>me<impt>j</impt>o</i>
      </example>
      <example>
        *<smallcaps>iocat</smallcaps> → Ven. [ˈzoga] $<i><impt>gi</impt>oga</i>, <i><impt>j</impt>oga</i>
      </example>
      <example>
        <smallcaps>generum</smallcaps> “son-in-law” → Ven. [ˈzɛnero] $<i><impt>g</impt>ènero</i>
      </example>
      <h4>Modern yod: the use of ⟨j⟩ vs ⟨y⟩ vs ⟨i⟩</h4>
      <p>Different Romance languages have different traditions for writing the sound [j].</p>
      <p>Some do not distinguish it from [i] at all in writing, such as modern Italian, Catalan, Portuguese and Romanian; so that is certainly an option for a ROR orthography, if no or little ambiguity arises from such a choice. Other languages, however, do differentiate [j] in writing. Older Italian and many Romance minority languages in Italy traditionally use ⟨j⟩ for [j], while French and Spanish use ⟨y⟩. The preference for ⟨i⟩, ⟨j⟩ or ⟨y⟩ relies mainly on the interconnected strategies adopted for handling Latin yod (see §<a href="#latyod">Latin yod</a>) and the treatment of Latin ⟨c⟩ and ⟨g⟩ before front vowels (see §<a href="#latcg">Latin <smallcaps>c</smallcaps> and <smallcaps>g</smallcaps> before front vowels</a>).</p>
      <h4 id="latcg">Latin <smallcaps>c</smallcaps> and <smallcaps>g</smallcaps> before front vowels</h4>
      <p>Probably the most important choice to make when creating a reintegrationist orthography is how the letters ⟨c⟩ and ⟨g⟩ are handled. The following suggestions are especially recommended.</p>
      <p>Before ⟨a, o, u⟩, the sound [k] should always be written with the letter ⟨c⟩, and the sound [g] should always be written with the letter ⟨g⟩. [k, g] should be written ⟨c, g⟩ also at the end of a word—unless some kind of liaison is present, in which case it is advisable to use a system inspired by French.</p>
      <p>The use of the sequences ⟨ce, ci⟩ depends on the evolution of Latin <smallcaps>c</smallcaps> and <smallcaps>g</smallcaps> before <smallcaps>e</smallcaps> and <smallcaps>i</smallcaps> at the beginning of word-initial, stressed syllables. These will be referred to as <i>palatal ⟨c⟩</i> and <i>palatal ⟨g⟩</i>, regardless of whether their realisations in modern languages have a palatal place of articulation. Take for example French <i>cent</i> and <i>sent</i>. Much like the Catalan examples <i>cena</i> and <i>sena</i> above, they are pronounced the same, but the initial [s] is represented according to its origin in Latin. A ROR orthography should reflect this: palatal ⟨c⟩ and palatal ⟨g⟩ before ⟨e, i⟩ cannot be represented with letters other than ⟨c⟩ and ⟨g⟩.</p>
      <p>Many RMLs do not represent this faithfully, since their orthography is based on the way sounds are represented in the majority language of the state or nation where they are spoken. See the following examples.</p>

<h4>The ⟨s⟩ rule</h4>
      <p>It is recommended that a sound derived from Latin S be written with ⟨s⟩ or ⟨ss⟩, especially when the sound is [s] or [z]. However, this is a flexible guideline that may be disregarded in cases where following it would result in an orthographic form that makes it difficult for the reader to predict the pronunciation of a word.</p>
      <h4>The <i>velar table</i></h4>
      <p>A way to write [k] and [g] before front vowels must be found. Strategies must also be developed to represent the sounds written with palatal ⟨c⟩ and ⟨g⟩ when they occur before back vowels.</p>
<p>I devised the following table which helps with creating said conventions, and which should be valid for all languages of reference <i>and</i> ROR orthographies. To illustrate how the table works, I will take Catalan as an example.

</table></div>
<p>There are two prominent strategies to write the sounds [k] and [g] before ⟨e, i⟩.</p>
<p>The first is the use of ⟨qu⟩ and ⟨gu⟩ (e.g. as in Catalan), while the second is the use of ⟨ch⟩ and ⟨gh⟩ (as in Italian, for example). This choice rests on the language’s phonotactics and sound inventory. If the language has the sequences [kw] and [gw], the orthographer might want to use ⟨qu⟩ and ⟨gu⟩ to represent them, reserving ⟨ch⟩ and ⟨gh⟩ for [k] and [g] before ⟨e, i⟩. If the language does not display frequent use of sequences [kw, gw], the choice is a little freer. It must be noted that a diaeresis can be used to distinguish [kw, gw] from [k, g] if needed or desired (⟨qü, gü⟩), much like in Catalan; another option is the Spanish strategy of constrasting ⟨qu⟩ [k] vs ⟨cu⟩ [kw].</p>
<p>One consideration to make is whether the digraph ⟨ch⟩, which is quite common among the languages of reference, is useful to represent another phoneme or sound entirely; it is most common for some kind of palatalisation before ⟨a, o, u⟩—see  French <i>chat</i> (← <smallcaps>cattum</smallcaps>) and Portuguese <i>chorar</i> (← <smallcaps>plōrāre</smallcaps>). Selecting ⟨ch⟩ to represent [k] rather than some kind of palatalised sound depends on the orthographer and, most importantly, to the language’s sound inventory: it is necessary to evaluate what graphemes the RML needs to represent all of its phonemes.</p>
<p>In order to write the sounds typically associated with palatalised ⟨c⟩ and ⟨g⟩ before ⟨a, o, u⟩, Catalan uses ⟨ç, ss, s⟩ for [s] and ⟨j⟩ for [(d)ʒ]. The choice between ⟨ç⟩ and ⟨ss⟩ is often etymological, while ⟨s⟩ is most commonly employed at word boundaries. As an example, let’s take the Catalan verb <i>alçar</i> “to lift” and the Spanish noun <i>pez</i> “fish”.</p>
<example><i>al<impt>ç</impt>ar</i> [alˈ<impt>s</impt>aɾ] (infinitive)</example>
<example><i>al<impt>c</impt>es</i> [ˈal<impt>s</impt>es] “you lift”</example>
<example><i>pe<impt>z</impt></i> [pe<impt>θ</impt>]</example>
<example><i>pe<impt>c</impt>es</i> [ˈpe<impt>θ</impt>es] (plural)</example>
<p>In Catalan, ⟨ç⟩ and ⟨c⟩ are used to maintain the pronunciation [s] throughout the paradigm. The same goes for Spanish, where ⟨z, c⟩ are part of an alternating orthographic paradigm.</p>
<p>In this case, the orthographer has much liberty. The most common spellings for the sounds associated with palatal ⟨c⟩ and ⟨g⟩ are:</p>
<example><ul>
  <li>for ⟨c⟩: <i><b>ci</b></i> + vowel, <i><b>z</b></i>, <i><b>ç/ss/s</b></i> (also attested among RMLs: <i><b>ch</b></i>, <i><b>tch</b></i>, <i><b>tg</b></i>; other additional possibilities: <i><b>sh</b></i>, <i><b>sch</b></i>, <i><b>x</b></i>);</li>
  <li>for ⟨g⟩: <i><b>gi</b></i> + vowel, <i><b>j</b></i>, <i><b>ge</b></i> + vowel (also attested among RMLs: <i><b>z</b></i>, <i><b>sgi</b></i> + vowel (for [ʒ]), <i><b>sg</b></i> (for [ʒ]); other additional possibilities: <i><b>x</b></i>, <i><b>sj</b></i>; see also §<a href="#latyod">Latin yod</a>.</li>
</ul></example>
